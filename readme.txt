Allows a download to be hidden as well as preventing direct access to the download

== Description ==

This plugin requires [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/ "Easy Digital Downloads"). 

It allows you to:

1. Hide a download so it doesn't appear on the custom post type archive page, anywhere where the [downloads] shortcode is being used, or any custom query on a page template
1. Prevent direct access to the download. The browser will redirect the user to the site's homepage.
1. Do a combination of hiding the download and preventing direct access to it

This plugin is extremely useful in the following situations:

1. You've created a product landing page and inserted a buy now button to your product. Since the landing page contains all the required product information, you can hide the product on the rest of your site and even prevent direct access to it.
1. You've added a product (eg support package) that shouldn't sit with your other products you have listed. In this case we can simply hide it from appearing with the other products and insert it where we'd like it to appear using the shortcode. 

**Filter example**

Example filter of how you can change the redirect based on the download ID. Copy this function to your child theme's functions.php or custom plugin

    function sumobi_custom_edd_hide_download_redirect( $url ) {
    	// download has ID of 17
		if ( '17' == get_the_ID() ) {
			$url = 'http://easydigitaldownloads.com'; // redirect user to another external URL
		}
		
		// download has ID of 15
		if( '15' == get_the_ID() ) {
			$url = get_permalink( '8' ); // redirect to another download which has an ID of 8
		}
		
		// return our new URL
		return $url;
	}
	add_filter( 'edd_hide_download_redirect', 'sumobi_custom_edd_hide_download_redirect' );

Example filter of how you can globally change the redirect. Copy this function to your child theme's functions.php or custom plugin

    function sumobi_custom_edd_hide_download_redirect_url( $url ) {
		$url = get_permalink( '8' ); // redirect to another download, post or page
		
		return $url;
	}
	add_filter( 'edd_hide_download_redirect', 'sumobi_custom_edd_hide_download_redirect' );
