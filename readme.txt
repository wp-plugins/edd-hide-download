Prevents a download appearing on the custom post type archive page or [downloads] listing.

Allows you to hide a download so it does not appear on the custom post type archive page or anywhere where the [downloads] shortcode is being used. Useful for when you want to show the download by itself and don't want it appearing in the main download loops.
